A Flash Card System in C++.

This tool manages the making, testing, editting of
simple flash cards.
A flash card has a question string and an answer string.
User can check whether he remembers the answer corresponding
to the question; question appears, user checks himself whether
he remembers it, and press 'ENTER', and see the answer, and
user can tell this program whether he successfully answered or not.
The more a user answers a card correct consecutively, the less the card
will appear on the test.
